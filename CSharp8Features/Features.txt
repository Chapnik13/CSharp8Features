Disposable ref structs => A struct declared with the ref modifier may not implement any interfaces and so can't implement IDisposable. 
                            Therefore, to enable a ref struct to be disposed, it must have an accessible void Dispose() method. 
                            This feature also applies to readonly ref struct declarations.
